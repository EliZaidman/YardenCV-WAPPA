Vertical Slice was created for **Global Game Jam 2023**, with the goal of building a tiny but complete “slice” of a polished experience.

## My Role

- Implemented the **state machine** and core gameplay flow  
- Built moment-to-moment **feel**: hit flashes, camera bumps, SFX triggers, animations  
- Created in-game UI elements for health, feedback, and transitions  
- Coordinated with teammates to maintain tight scope and deliver a stable build

## Highlights

- A complete, understandable gameplay loop in only 48 hours  
- Strong clarity and feedback for first-time players  
- Minimal bugs thanks to simple but effective state-driven architecture

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Finishing a complete slice**  
  Cut any features that threatened stability to ensure a fully playable jam build.

- **Fast feedback iteration**  
  Tuned timing, movement, and responsiveness continuously during playtests.

## Tech Stack

- Unity (C#)  
- 2D gameplay systems  
- Jam-ready state architecture
- Adding animations using Spine
