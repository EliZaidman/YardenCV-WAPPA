This Item Generation System is a modular, data-driven framework for **procedural loot** across multiple project types.

## My Role

- Designed and implemented the entire **loot generation pipeline**  
- Created **ScriptableObject item definitions** with rarity, categories, and filters  
- Built weighted drop tables with support for level scaling and conditional logic  
- Exposed a clean API (e.g., `GetDrop(category, level)`) usable by gameplay systems

## Highlights

- Fully data-driven — designers can edit loot without code changes  
- Supports rarity weighting, category filters, and “no-duplicate” rules  
- Modular structure makes it reusable across multiple projects

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Content tuning complexity**  
  Built weighted rarity tables and filtering rules so balancing required no code changes.

- **Different game modes**  
  Added flexible categories (enemy-type, chest-type, shop) so one system worked everywhere.

## Tech Stack

- Unity (C#)  
- ScriptableObjects  
- Weighted tables & filters
