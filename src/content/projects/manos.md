**Manos: Land of Bal** is a dark-fantasy **3D tactical RPG**, developed as my final-year capstone project at Tiltan.  
I served as the **Lead Developer & Producer**, responsible for both the technical foundation and the production workflow of a 7-person team.

## My Role

- Led a multidisciplinary team of **7 people** (3 programmers, 4 artists/designers)  
- Implemented the **turn-based combat system**, initiative order, action points, and turn states  
- Built **UI/UX** for combat, abilities, unit selection, HUD elements, and interaction feedback  
- Developed the full **ability system using ScriptableObjects**, supporting data-driven skills  
- Implemented **ability interaction flow**: clicking abilities, validating targets, highlighting tiles, displaying costs and effects  
- Created **grid selection & tile logic** for movement, range, and target validation  
- Developed foundational **enemy AI** and basic combat decision-making  
- Managed production: roadmap, sprints, priorities, and milestone delivery

## Systems I Built

- **Turn Manager** — manages initiative, action points, character states, and round flow  
- **Grid & Tile System** — movement cost, tile highlighting, range indicators, targeting rules  
- **Ability Framework (ScriptableObject-based)**  
  - Ability data stored in SOs  
  - Defines damage, range, costs, effects, cooldowns  
  - Modular, expandable, and designer-friendly  
- **Ability Interaction UI**  
  - Clickable abilities  
  - Shows AP cost, range, and valid tiles  
  - Smooth highlight/selection feedback  
- **Enemy AI** — heuristics for target selection and turn decisions

## Focus Areas

- Making tactical decisions **clear and readable** with visual cues  
- Building **modular Unity C# systems** that designers could extend without touching code  
- Ensuring UI and gameplay logic stayed tightly integrated and consistent  
- Coordinating the entire team so animation, design, and programming moved together  
- Delivering a polished, cohesive vertical slice demonstrating strong fundamentals in  
  **Unity development, system design, UI/UX, and team leadership**
