Valentina in Space was created in **48 hours** during Global Game Jam 2022 and went on to win **first place globally**.

## My Role

- Implemented the **core gameplay loop**, character movement, and interactions in Unity  
- Prototyped mechanics rapidly to determine what felt fun within the tight jam scope  
- Built the **feedback layer** (juice, timing, animations, audio triggers)  
- Collaborated closely with the team to refine pacing and readability

## Highlights

- Reached a polished, playable loop within the first 24 hours  
- Strong emphasis on timing, game feel, and clarity despite limited content  
- A complete, charming slice delivered under extreme deadline pressure

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Scope control**  
  Cut multiple mechanics during the first day to focus on one clean, polished idea.

- **Polish within a deadline**  
  Prioritized feedback (SFX, animation cues, clear transitions) instead of adding risky new content.

## Tech Stack

- Unity (C#)  
- 2D mechanics & feedback  
- Jam-focused rapid iteration
